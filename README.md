# ios-boilerplate-objc
This project demonstrates how you can implement the fliclib framework in an Objective-C application. Please note that this project is just a basic setup and is therefore not set up for background execution. All further information needed is available at our developer portal. 

# Instructions

1. Fetch the fliclib submodule by running this command:

    ```git submodule update --init --recursive```

2. Select an iOS Device as build target (Currently you cannot build this project for the simulator)
